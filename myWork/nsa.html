                                    the
                                    national security needs of partners of the agency who work in private industry
                                    defense

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The NSA is an unusual website because it represents an agency that is not well understood or
                        trusted by the general public. However, its website still needs to be accessible and easy to
                        navigate. This redesign seeks to correct accessibility issues from inadequate color contrast and
                        shape, and improve navigation, especially for private industry and defense contractors who rely
                        on the NSA’s services to protect vital national security interests. </p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>As a UX researcher and designer, my responsibility is to identify accessibility and navigation
                        issues on the original NSA website, create a redesign, and test the redesign to ensure that it
                        meets accessibility and navigation needs.</p>
                    <h3>Scope of Project</h3>
                    <p>The scope of this redesign is limited to redesigning the home page of the website and navigation
                        elements within a 5-week peroid. Feedback from actual professionals in the national security
                        field would be extremely helpful, but such information would be expected to not be accessible in
                        a timely manner due to national security reasons.</p>

                    <h2>Design Analysis</h2>
                    <h3>Assumptions and Proto-Persona</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the assumption that people who work in national defense or security would most likely use
                        the NSA website, I created a proto-persona: Joe, an engineering director at Raytheon, a US
                        warhead manufacturer.

                        For Joe to fulfill his duties at Raytheon, he needs to stay up-to-date about national security
                        protocols to protect his workplace and cooperate with other US defense organizations. As a
                        director, he does not have much time to sit down to browse websites like the NSA’s.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Website Test Plan</h3>
                    <p>
                        I partnered with fellow designer Muskan K. to collectively perform initial testing on the NSA’s
                        original website with users. Users were asked to complete these tasks on the desktop version of
                        the website:
                        Scroll through the home page
                        Go to the “News and Highlights” section and read a news article
                        Go to the “Cybersecurity Advisories” section and read a guidance document
                        We chose these particular tasks because we were under the impression that people in national
                        security would need to stay up-to-date on world events.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        After reviewing the user test notes, 4 notable pain points were identified:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Header Navigation Bar: Users found the top navigation bar to be confusing and
                            non-descriptive.
                            This may hinder some users’ ability to locate documents.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finding Documents: Users want the “Cybersecurity Guidance” document selection to be sortable
                            by
                            other categories other than time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finding News: Users were easily able to find news through the middle of the home page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aesthetics: Users did not like the heading font. The hard edges and retro aesthetic of the
                            heading font may contribute negatively to readability.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Navigation Analysis</h2>
                    <h3>Pre-testing the Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muskan and I tested the navigation on the desktop version of the website on our own to initially
                        identify the mechanics and issues with the header. Some notable points were:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Hovering over a primary category reveals a dropdown of secondary categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The secondary category “Cybersecurity Collaboration Center” is the only secondary category
                            with
                            a tertiary category dropdown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hovering over the categories is the only way to identify if the category has sub-categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The primary category “Careers” has no dropdown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The sitemap provided by the website is extremely long and vertical.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Navigation Test Plan</h3>
                    <p>To assess the usability of the navigation specifically, we tested additional users to complete
                        the following tasks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Use the top nav bar to find news
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the top nav bar to find out collaboration or partnerships with the NSA
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the footer to find the NSA’s contact info
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our testing with 4 users revealed additional issues with the navigation:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users may not have been able to distinguish between the navigation categories because of the
                            verbosity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The hovering mechanic of the header navigation slowed navigation down due to mouse aiming
                            issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some users did not notice the header navigation until later in the test session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users were not aware of tertiary dropdowns.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                    <p>Because the NSA’s website is written in English, it can be assumed that its users read left to
                        right. The sitemap was rearranged to facilitate left-to-right reading instead of up-to-down in
                        the original website. The initial set of new primary categories are:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>

                    <h3>Design Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used an InVision board to organize various inspirations for the redesign of the NSA’s
                        website. It contains 3 sections:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Overall design choices, pulled from Dribble and various other US government websites
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            UI patterns of balance and contrast
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aesthetic design choices, with potential colors, fonts, and background images pulled
                            directly from the NSA’s original website
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Low-Fidelity Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        As to not disturb users’ familiarity with the website, the homepage’s overall layout was
                        retained. However, some design choices were changed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The header navigation was changed to be under the logo instead of inline with the logo </li>
                        <li>
                            Primary dropdowns now reveal a full-width megamenu that reads left to right. </li>
                        <li>
                            The search bar was made round and solid white to ease the strain on the eyes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The navigation categories and the NSA’s slogans were kept for the introductory
                            section/hero/jumbotron. For the purposes of 5-second testing, copy text outside of the
                            header and hero were replaced with generated lorem ipsum.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>5-Second Test</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used the test platform service UsabilityHub to assess users’ first impression of the homepage
                        redesign. The following short questions were asked:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            What was the first thing you noticed?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Who do you think this website is intended to serve?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Write the name of one of the categories on the header that you can remember.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I shared this link in a Slack channel and received 7 responses. After analyzing the responses,
                        here are some notable findings:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users typically noticed the top of the page and the hero text first.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users can tell this is a site for the NSA at first glance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users recalled between 0 to 3 header categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some users wanted the grey-black background to have more contrast, but others found the
                            grey-black background fitting for the NSA’s nature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                    <h3>Mid-Fidelity Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        In response to the feedback from the 5-second test, the following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The 6 primary categories in the header were rearranged to be left-justified instead of
                            center-equidistant, and the names were changed to be as short as possible for each.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mega-menus now include the name of the category and a section summary to the left, and
                            the subcategories to the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Background images and actual copy from the NSA’s website were added to the rest of the
                            homepage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The background color was changed from alternating grey-black to alternating dark
                            background-white.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A style tile was also created to serve as a reference for the elements used in the mid-fidelity
                        prototype.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Prototype Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I tested the mid-fi prototype with 3 additional users, using the same navigation tests as in
                        Phase 2.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users generally found the choice of font and colors to be easy to read.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users found news quickly through the header or news highlights in the body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users found it difficult to locate “collaboration” but found it by going through each header
                            category.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users expected contact info to be either with "Careers" or "About Us".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Post-Test Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Secondary category font size was increased from 12px to 14px for better visibility.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The video was replaced with an expanding call-to-action (CTA) button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Contact Us” was added under the “About Us” and “Careers” categories.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Future Opportunities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before the high-fidelity prototype can be made, the following changes should be made to the
                        mid-fidelity prototype:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A/B testing should be conducted on the hero section to see whether users prefer to see the
                            NSA’s introduction video straight away or view it by clicking the CTA button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The “News” and “Partnerships” pages should be prototyped to redesign and test those parts of
                            the original website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The style tile should include the 25 essential elements of web forms to create forms for
                            private industry partners to fill out for national security assistance.
                        </li>
