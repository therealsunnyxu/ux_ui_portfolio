                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The NSA, National Security Agency, already has a confusing reputation as the surveillance wing of
                        the US
                        Department of Defense. For visitors of their website, it’s even more confusing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This redesign study seeks to <b>improve navigation</b>, and <b>correct accessibility issues</b>
                        from
                        inadequate color contrast and
                        shape, especially for private industry and defense contractors <b>who rely
                            on the NSA’s services</b> to protect vital national security interests.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>As a UX researcher and designer, my responsibility is to identify accessibility and navigation
                        issues on the original NSA website, create a redesign, and test the redesign to ensure that it
                        meets accessibility and navigation needs.</p>
                    <h3>Scope of Project</h3>
                    <p>The scope of this redesign is limited to redesigning the home page of the website and navigation
                        elements within a 5-week period. Actually reaching out to national security professionals is out
                        of the
                        scope; therefore the design will be assumed to cater towards typical civilians.</p>

                    <h2>Design Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Contributors: Sunny Xu, Muskan K.</p>
                    <h3>Intended Userbase</h3>
                    <p><b>Who would use the NSA's website?</b></p>
                    <p>Since Muskan or I are unable to contact national security professionals, we created a fictional
                        persona: Joe, an
                        engineering director at a defense manufacturing firm, to represent civilian users</p>

                    <p>For Joe to fulfill his duties, he needs to <b>stay up-to-date about national
                            security</b>
                        protocols to <b>protect his workplace and cooperate with other US defense</b> organizations. As
                        a
                        director, he <b>does not have much time to sit down to browse</b> websites like the NSA’s, and
                        he may
                        even ask his subordinates to look at it instead, who <b>may not be in the know</b>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing the NSA's Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        I partnered with fellow designer Muskan K. to collectively perform initial testing on the NSA’s
                        original website with users. </p>
                    <p>Users were asked to complete these tasks on the desktop version of
                        the website:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scroll through the home page</li>
                        <li>Go to the “News and Highlights” section and read a news article</li>
                        <li> Go to the “Cybersecurity Advisories” section and read a guidance document</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        After reviewing the user test notes, 4 notable pain points were identified:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Header Navigation Bar:</b> Users were confused about <b>similarly-named categories</b>,
                            especially the
                            three different categories with the words "cybersecurity" in it.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Finding News:</b> Users were <b>easily able to find news</b> through the middle of the
                            home
                            page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Aesthetics:</b> Users did not like the H1 font, likely due to how narrow the gaps are.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Navigation Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Contributors: Sunny Xu, Muskan K.</p>
                    <h3>Navigation Self-Test</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muskan and I tested the navigation on the desktop version of the website on our own to initially
                        identify the functionality of the header. Some notable points were:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Hovering over a primary category reveals a dropdown of secondary categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The secondary category “Cybersecurity Collaboration Center” is the only secondary category
                            with
                            a tertiary category dropdown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hovering over the categories is the only way to identify if the category has sub-categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The primary category “Careers” has no dropdown.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Navigation Test Plan</h3>
                    <p>To assess the usability of the navigation specifically, we tested additional users to complete
                        the following tasks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Use the top nav bar to find news
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the top nav bar to find out collaboration or partnerships with the NSA
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the footer to find the NSA’s contact info
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our testing with 4 users revealed additional issues with the navigation:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users may not have been able to distinguish between the navigation categories because of the
                            <b>verbosity</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>hover reveal</b> of the header navigation <b>slowed navigation</b> down due to
                            mouse
                            aiming
                            issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some users did not notice the header navigation until later in the test session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users were not aware of tertiary dropdowns, likely because of a <b>lack of visual cues</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I used an InVision board to organize various inspirations for the redesign of the NSA’s
                        website. It contains 3 sections:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Overall design choices, pulled from Dribble and various other US government websites
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            UI patterns of balance and contrast

                        <li>
                            Aesthetic design choices, with potential colors, fonts, and background images pulled
                            directly from the NSA’s original website
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Low-Fidelity Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        As to not disturb users’ familiarity with the website, the homepage’s overall layout was
                        retained. However, some design choices were changed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The header navigation was changed to be <b>under the logo</b> instead of inline with the
                            logo.</li>
                        <li>
                            The search bar was made round and solid white to <b>ease the strain on the eyes</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The navigation categories and the NSA’s slogans were kept for the introductory
                            section/hero/jumbotron. Since users would not have time to glance at everything for 5
                            seconds, copy text was written using lorem ipsum generators.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>5-Second Test</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used the test platform service UsabilityHub to assess users’ first impression of the homepage
                        redesign, using an unsupervised test link. The following short questions were asked:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            What was the <b>first thing you noticed</b>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Who do you think this website is <b>intended to serve</b>?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Write the name of one of the categories on the header that <b>you can remember</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I shared this link in a Slack channel and received 7 responses. After analyzing the responses,
                        here are some notable findings:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users typically noticed the <b>top of the page and the hero</b> text first.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users can tell this is a site for the NSA at first glance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users <b>recalled between 0 to 3 primary</b> categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some users wanted the grey-black background to have more contrast, but others found the
                            grey-black background fitting for the NSA’s nature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Mid-Fidelity Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        In response to the feedback from the 5-second test, the following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The 6 primary categories in the header were rearranged to be left-justified instead of
                            center-equidistant, and the <b>names were changed to be as short as possible</b> for each.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mega-menus now include the name of the category and a <b>section summary</b> to the
                            left, and
                            the subcategories to the right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Background images and actual copy text from the NSA’s website were added to the rest of the
                            homepage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The background color was changed from alternating grey-black to alternating dark
                            background-white.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Prototype Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I tested the mid-fi prototype with 3 additional users, using the same navigation tests as in
                        Phase 2.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users generally found the choice of font and colors to be <b>easy to read</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users found news <b>quickly through the header or news highlights</b> in the body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users found it difficult to locate “collaboration” but found it by going through each header
                            category.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users expected contact info to be either with "Careers" or "About Us".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Post-Test Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Secondary category font size was increased from 12px to 14px for <b>better visibility</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The video was replaced with an <b>expanding call-to-action (CTA) button</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Contact Us” was added under the “About Us” and “Careers” categories.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Future Opportunities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before the high-fidelity prototype and actual website can be made, the following changes should
                        be made to the
                        mid-fidelity prototype:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A/B testing should be conducted on the hero section to see whether users prefer to see the
                            NSA’s introduction video straight away or view it by clicking the CTA button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>“News” and “Partnerships” pages should be prototyped</b> to redesign and test those
                            parts of
                            the original website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A mobile prototype <b>should be developed for mobile users</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this website redesign study proved to be an excellent experience to <b>learn how users
                            navigate websites</b> that they're <b>unfamiliar</b> with, and design webpage components to
                        <b>make navigation smoother</b> and easier.
